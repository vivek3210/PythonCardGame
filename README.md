# PythonCardGame
A project done for the lab section of CS1321.

Description of game: 
The basic idea is that it is a multiplayer versus game where you draw 3 playing cards with numbers 1-10 each round, afterwhich you assign each one to attack, shield, and energy. Assigning your card to attack will cause him to deal damage to your opponent equal to the number on your card. Assigning to the shield will create a temporary shield for the round that will absorb damage equivalent to the card. Assigning to the energy will charge up the ability to shuffle the deck and give you 3 new cards for your turn. The game ends when one player reaches zero HP or below.
