# PythonCardGame
A project done for the lab section of CS1321.

Description of game: 
The basic idea is that it is a multiplayer versus game where you draw 3 playing cards with numbers 1-10 each round, afterwhich you assign each one to one of the 3 face cards. Assigning your card to the king will cause him to deal damage to your opponent equal to the number on your card. Assigning to the queen will create a temporary shield for the round that will absorb damage equivalent to the card. Assigning to the jack will charge up the ability to shuffle the deck and give you 3 new cards for your turn. The game ends when one player reaches zero HP or below.
